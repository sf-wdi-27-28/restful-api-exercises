Week 3 Homework 1

We also want to get some flavors by category, like "fruity", "gluten free", or "chunky". Finally we want to add one POST route that allows users of our API to add new flavors!

GET ALL ICECREAM"/icecream"

GET ICECREAM BY FLAVOR "/icecream/:flavor"

GET ALL FLAVOR "/flavor"

POST FLAVOR  "/api/flavor"
