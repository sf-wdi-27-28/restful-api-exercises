POST
----
app.post('/iceCreams', function iceCreamsCreate(req, res) {
  //Save data and say something about it.
})
*If the body parser middleware is used:
app.post('/iceCreams', function iceCreamsCreate(req, res) {
  var name=req.body.name;
  var brand=req.body.brand;
  var newIceCream = { name: name, brand: brand};
  iceCreams.push(newIceCream);
  res.json(iceCreams);
})
