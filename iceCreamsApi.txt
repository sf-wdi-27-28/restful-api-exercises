### Now its your turn.

Say we want to create an API similar to the one above,
that returns data about icecream.
We need to be able to get information about specific flavors,
as well as all of the flavors we have in our database.
We also want to get some flavors by category, like "fruity", "gluten free", or "chunky".

Finally we want to add one POST route that allows users of our API to add new flavors!

Write Pseudocode like the above. Be creative, and follow RESTful conventions and best practices.

### Deliverables

Fork and clone

Submit
your pseudocode
in a markdown or text file
by making
a pull request
on
this repository.


//My pseudo code routes

GET ALL ICECREAMS "/icecreams"
GET ALL ICECREAMS FLAVORS "icecreams:id"
GET ALL FLAVORTYPES "/flavors"
GET ALL FLAVORTYPES KIND "/flavors:id"

POST NEW FLAVORTYPES "/flavors"

__Note__: In the above example any code preceded by a colon is a __variable__ which would be filled in by specific information in the real requests. This is typical syntax in talking about variables in routes.

That's all there is to it!
